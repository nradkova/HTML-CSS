              Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
              object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and
              other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
              ago.

              Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital
              plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
              between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
              orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
